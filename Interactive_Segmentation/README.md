# Interactive Segmentation

## Goal
-	Convert image segmentation into a graph optimization using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Field

## Related work
-	Recommends which slice to annotate next (similar to active learning)
-	No need for parameter tuning for each application (imaging type + objects of interest)

-	Manual annotation tools
	-	Line tracing
	-	Polynomial curve fitting
	-	Area painting
	-	ITK-Snap
	-	3D-Slicer

-	Semi-automatic
	-	Allow user interaction to improve labels
	-	Iterative improvement by adding scribbles - grow cuts and graph cuts

-	Types of user annotation
	-	Point-based
	-	Contour-based
	-	**Scribble-based**
	-	Bbox-based

-	Comment on CNN approaches
	-	The main drawback of these DCNN-based methods is the requirement of a training process using either weakly or fully labeled data.

## Method
-	Problem is formulated as Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) inference in a CRF
-	Each class has its own energy function - the energy must be minimized to solve which pixel is assinged to a certain class
-	The pairwise energy is lower for pixels which are 
	-	Similar in appearance
	-	Closer to each other (smoothness)
-	The unary **class** energy is lower for pixels which are:
	-	Similar in appearance to mean class intensity
	-	Closer to the nearest annotated pixel of the class (using geodesic distance)
-	Uncertainty of slice through entropy 
-	Annotation is propagated to 3D volumes trought the labels of few slices (smoothness term)
-	Pro: 
	-	Does not require accurate contour tracing which needs lower concentration levels from the annotator
-	Cons:
	-	Not particulary suitable for blood vessel segmentation
