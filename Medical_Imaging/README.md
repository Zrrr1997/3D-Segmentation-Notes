# CT (Computer Tomography)
## History
Found by Sir Godfrey Hounsfiel, Electrical Engineer. 

## Summary of Workflow
Multiple images in succession of a different layers of the body. Organs and tissues of the body attenuate the X-Rays to difference degrees. X-Rays pass through the body, are attenuated, and are detected through sensors, which quantisize them into discrete brightness values. Amount of transmitted radiation = Brightness. Specific density values correspond to brightness steps. 

## Density Metric
Density is measured with the Hounsfield Unit (HU). Water = 0 HU, Air = -1000 HU. The higher the HU, and hence the density, the higher the brightness in the image.

## Contrastive medium
Patients might have to administer a contrast medium to make it easier to differentiate between different kinds of tissues. It drastically increases the stomach's contrast (appears brighter).

## Radiation dose
Relatively low - average natural radiation per year.
