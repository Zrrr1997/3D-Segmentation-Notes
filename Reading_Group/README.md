| UCP-Net | 2021 | SMC | Gaussian Distance Map | U-Net with EfficientNet backbone | ImageNet + SBD | Train: First pair of points - along breadth of object sampled from N(0, 0.03). Next points are sampled with the Geometric strategy: furthest GT pixel from the previous clicks. Corrective strategy during evaluation: Furthest GT pixel from the prediction mask.  | no | NoC@IoU, Average/Median Annotation Time (real annotators), IoU@NoC | no | no | New robot user model with geometric and corrective clicks. | VOS-Wild, DEXTR, CM-guidance, ITIS, LD, BRS, f-BRS, 99%-Acc, DIOS, RIS-Net, two-stream, MultiSeg, FAIRS | Dice Loss | Geometric clicks | no | yes | no | no |
